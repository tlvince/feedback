# tlvince/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

I'm [Tom Vincent](http://tlvince.com), a tech entrepreneur, programmer, musician
and writer from the UK.

Ask me anything.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/tlvince/feedback/issues/new).

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry; if you have any further
questions, just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [closed issues](https://github.com/tlvince/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@tlvince](https://twitter.com/tlvince) on
Twitter.

### Acknowledgements

The idea of using GitHub issues as a QA board was shamelessly stolen from [Zach
Holman](https://github.com/holman/feedback).
